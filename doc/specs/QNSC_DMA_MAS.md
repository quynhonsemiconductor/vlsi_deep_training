# 1. Overview

The DMA copies blocks of data between any two addresses of QSOC without the CPU
executing a load and a store per word. Firmware writes a source, a destination and a
length, launches the job, and continues or sleeps until the DMA interrupt.

The fact that shapes it: it is **`pulp-platform/iDMA` used as released**. Frontend,
midend and backend are upstream; this block is a wrapper that joins them and
connects them to `APB_M13` and `AXI_S2`.

Every transfer is started by software. There is **no hardware request from
peripherals**: a peripheral is reached as an ordinary address through `S_BUS`,
`AXI2APB` and `P_BUS`.

Block directory `design/dma`, wrapper `m_qnsc_wrap_dma`, owner Ong Bao Vinh.

# 2. Features

- Memory-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral and peripheral-to-memory copies at any byte
  address and length -- 7.1.
- 2D jobs: `REPS` repetitions with independent source and destination strides; a
  stride of 0 reaches a FIFO data register -- 7.3.
- AXI4 bursts on `AXI_S2`, 32-bit data -- 7.2.
- Configuration on `APB_M13`, upstream register file -- 6.
- One level interrupt while the DMA is idle -- 7.4.

Use in QSOC: block copies between memories and buffers, and SPI host and SPI Device
data at high rates. UART and I2C are served by the CPU: at 113 636 baud a 16-byte
FIFO needs one interrupt every 1.4 ms.

# 3. Block diagram

: Sub-blocks

| Block | Module | Source | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `idma_reg32_2d` | upstream, generated (7.6) | APB register file; builds a 2D job; launches it on a read of `NEXT_ID` |
| Transfer IDs | `idma_transfer_id_gen` | upstream | Issues the job ID returned by `NEXT_ID` (first ID 2); `issue` = frontend request handshake, `retire` = midend `nd_rsp_valid`, once per job |
| Midend | `idma_nd_midend` | upstream | Splits a 2D job into `REPS` 1D transfers; one response per job |
| Backend | `idma_backend_rw_axi` | upstream, generated (7.6) | Executes a 1D transfer as AXI4 read and write bursts |
| Port join | in `m_qnsc_wrap_dma` | wires | Read port AR/R and write port AW/W/B onto one AXI port, `AXI_S2` |
| Idle | in `m_qnsc_wrap_dma` | one NOR | `o_int_dma` = neither the midend nor a backend unit busy |

The block is in the `peri` clock cluster, `SCRC` `CLK_EN[10]`.

| `pulp-platform/common_cells` | `cc_pkg`; `cc_stream_fifo_optimal_wrap` (with `cc_stream_fifo`, `cc_fifo`, `cc_spill_register_flushable`), `cc_passthrough_stream_fifo`, `cc_fall_through_register`, `cc_rr_arb_tree` (with `cc_lzc`), `cc_popcount`, `cc_stream_fork`, `cc_stream_join`; `registers.svh`, `assertions.svh` | `db427693` (v2.0.0-beta.3+3), the copy `design/bus` uses; iDMA asks for 2.0.0-beta.3 | SHL-0.51 |

| `pulp-platform/apb` | `apb_pkg`, `apb/typedef.svh` | `6ae8bf8d`, as iDMA pins | SHL-0.51 |

The filelist is checked by `make lint` and `make vcs` once the wrapper exists: a module a tool reports missing is added, and nothing else. `idma_error_handler` and the on-the-fly compute modules sit only in generate branches this configuration does not elaborate.

Facts this specification relies on, read at that commit:

- Backend protocols: AXI4, AXI4-Lite, AXI4-Stream, OBI, TileLink, Init (`src/db`).
  No APB, which QSOC does not need: the configuration port is the frontend's.
- The frontend template has an APB4 configuration port (`--cpuif apb4-flat`, the
  `idma.mk` default) and a 32-bit variant. It has **no interrupt** and no hardware
  request input.
- A read of `NEXT_ID` launches the job and returns the next transfer ID; one launch
  is held until the midend accepts it (`idma_reg.sv.tpl`, `launch_pending_q`).
- `NEXT_ID` and `DONE_ID` are not stored: they read the ID generator, which resets
  to 2 and 1 (`idma_transfer_id_gen.sv`).
- The midend answers once per job (`nd_rsp_valid` = response valid AND `last`); the
  upstream reference frontend retires IDs on it (`idma_inst64_top.sv`).
- A write of `COMPUTE_CFG.compute_enable` = 1 reaches the legalizer and forces
  decoupled reads and writes even with `EnableCompute` = 0 (`idma_legalizer.sv.tpl`).
- The frontend drives `burst = INCR` for source and destination (`idma_reg.sv.tpl`).
- `idma_rt_midend` launches on a time counter, not on a peripheral event; it is not used.

: Configuration, fixed at the instances in `m_qnsc_wrap_dma`

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `reg32_2d`, `apb4-flat`, 1 register port, 1 stream | 32-bit system, 2D for the stride-0 case; one job stream |
| `DataWidth`, `AddrWidth` | 32, 32 | QSOC bus widths |
| `AxiIdWidth` | 5 | `AXI_S2` ID width assumed by `S_BUS` (`QNSC_BUS_MAS` 11) |
| `TFLenWidth` | 32 | `LENGTH` is a 32-bit register |
| `NumAxInFlight`, `BufferDepth` | 3, 3 | `BufferDepth` 3 is the upstream recommendation for misaligned transfers (byte copies to and from a peripheral); 2 is the minimum. Cost: 4 bytes of buffer and one FIFO slot |
| `RAWCouplingAvail`, `MaskInvalidData` | 1, 1 | `rw_axi` defaults: `AW` waits for the first `W` data; strobes outside valid bytes are 0 |
| `ErrorCap` | `NO_ERROR_HANDLING` | No error handler; its request port is tied off (10) -- 7.5 |
| `HardwareLegalizer`, `RejectZeroTransfers` | 1, 1 | Bursts split at 4 KiB and to legal lengths; a zero-length job is dropped |
| `EnableCompute` | 0 | No on-the-fly compute. Firmware keeps `COMPUTE_CFG` = 0 (4) |

# 6. Register map

<!-- gen:memory_map ports=APB_M13 -->
: Memory map, regions behind APB_M13

| Base | Size | Region | Port | Kind | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x80034000` | 16 KiB | `dma_cfg` | APB_M13 | peripheral | Register interface of the DMA |
<!-- /gen -->

The frontend decodes offset bits 7:0, so the map repeats every 256 bytes in the
window. The register block is `0xF0` bytes. All registers are 32-bit; an offset
with no register (`0xDC`, `0xF0`--`0xFF`) reads 0 and ignores writes.

: Register map, `idma_reg32_2d`

| Offset | Register | Access | Reset | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | `CONF` | RW | 0 | Job options, Figure 6-1 |
| `0x04` | `STATUS` | RO | 0 | `busy`: bit 8 midend, bits 7:0 the eight backend units of `idma_busy_t`; bit 9 reads 0 |

| `0xD4` | `SRC_ADDR` | RW | 0 | Source byte address |
| `0xD8` | `LENGTH` | RW | 0 | Bytes per 1D transfer; not 0 (7.5) |
| `0xDC` | -- | -- | -- | No register: the 2D group is aligned to 16 bytes |

| `0xE4` | `SRC_STRIDE` | RW | 0 | Source address step between repetitions |

| `0xEC` | `COMPUTE_CFG` | RW | 0 | Kept 0 by firmware (`EnableCompute` = 0; section 4) |

# 7. Functional behaviour

## 7.1 Job

![One DMA job, firmware view](../figures/img/fig_dma_flow.png){width=4.6in}

- A 1D job copies `LENGTH` bytes from `SRC_ADDR` to `DST_ADDR`, both incrementing.
  Addresses and length need no alignment; the backend handles the byte offsets.
- A 2D job (`enable_nd` = 1) copies `REPS` blocks of `LENGTH` bytes; block *k* starts
  at `SRC_ADDR` + *k* x `SRC_STRIDE` and `DST_ADDR` + *k* x `DST_STRIDE`.
- Reading `NEXT_ID` samples the registers and launches the job; the registers may be
  rewritten at once.
- The frontend holds one launch until the midend accepts it. Firmware runs one job at a time: it launches the next
  job after `DONE_ID` has reached the previous ID.
- `DONE_ID` is the ID of the last job completed. A job with ID *i* is complete when
  `DONE_ID` >= *i*, modulo 2^32.
- After reset the first `NEXT_ID` read returns 2 and `DONE_ID` reads 1; each launch
  adds 1. ID 0 is never issued. A read while a launch is still held returns that
  launch's ID again and launches nothing: firmware does not take it as a new job.
- A 1D job (`enable_nd` = 0) ignores `REPS`; the frontend uses 1.

## 7.2 Bus traffic

![A 1D job of four words, memory to memory](../figures/img/wave_dma_job.png){width=6.4in}

- Reads and writes use INCR bursts on `AXI_S2`, split at 4 KiB boundaries.
- With the `ISRAM`/`DSRAM` controller, a read burst returns one beat every 2 cycles
  and a write burst takes one beat per cycle (`QNSC_RAM_MAS` 7.1): about 2 cycles per
  word, against about 10 for a CPU copy loop (estimate, not simulated).
- A peripheral address goes through `AXI_M3`, `AXI2APB` and `P_BUS`: one APB access
  per beat.
- The DMA and Ibex share `S_BUS`; the crossbar arbitrates between them.

## 7.3 Peripheral FIFO: stride 0

A FIFO data register is reached with a 2D job whose peripheral-side stride is 0:

: Examples

| Job | `SRC_ADDR` | `DST_ADDR` | `LENGTH` | `REPS` | `SRC_STRIDE` | `DST_STRIDE` |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 16 bytes to `UART0` THR | buffer | `0x8002_0000` | 1 | 16 | 1 | 0 |
| 16 bytes from `UART0` RBR | `0x8002_0000` | buffer | 1 | 16 | 0 | 1 |
| 4 KiB memory copy (1D) | source | destination | 4096 | -- | -- | -- |

Firmware starts a FIFO job only when the FIFO has room or data for all `REPS`
entries, for example from the peripheral's FIFO interrupt. Nothing paces the DMA by
the peripheral.

## 7.4 Interrupt

- `o_int_dma` = 1 while neither the midend nor any backend unit is busy (`STATUS` =
  0). It is a level, 1 out of reset.
- **Idle is not done.** The line is 1 while a job is unfinished in two windows: about
  one cycle after the `NEXT_ID` read, before the midend takes the launch; and from the
  last `W` beat until the last `B` response returns, since no busy flag waits for `B`
  (`w_dp_busy` = request pending OR last beat; RTL reading, `DMA_010` confirms it).
- Firmware enables `mie` bit 16 after launching, and the handler compares `DONE_ID`
  with the launched ID: equal or later, the job is done and the handler clears
  `mie[16]`; earlier, it returns. In the second window the handler may run several
  times in a row until `DONE_ID` advances; this is expected.
- Line 0 is the highest-priority fast line (`QNSC_Interrupt_Map_MAS` 7.2).

## 7.5 Errors

- **`LENGTH` = 0 is not launched.** The backend makes no access but answers each 1D
  transfer with an error response marked last. A 1D job then advances `DONE_ID` once;
  a 2D job advances it `REPS` times, and job IDs no longer match.
- **`REPS` = 0 with `enable_nd` = 1 is not launched.** The midend makes no transfer and
  answers with an error; `DONE_ID` advances as for a completed job.
- With `ErrorCap` = `NO_ERROR_HANDLING`, an AXI error response on `AXI_S2` (decode
  error, `SLVERR` from the ROM or a blocked peripheral) is not reported: the job
  completes and `DONE_ID` advances. The data of the failed beat is written, undefined.
- No error response reaches `STATUS` or the interrupt: the frontend has no error field.

## 7.6 Generated files

The frontend, the backend and one header are generated once, at the pinned commit,
and committed with the commands that made them in `util/gen/idma/`. From the iDMA
root:

```
python -m peakrdl regblock src/frontend/reg/idma_reg.rdl -o <out> \
    --default-reset arst_n --cpuif apb4-flat \
    --module-name idma_reg32_2d_reg_top --package idma_reg32_2d_reg_pkg \

```

: Generated files

| File | Module | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `idma_reg32_2d_reg_pkg.sv`, `idma_reg32_2d_reg_top.sv` | `idma_reg32_2d_reg_top` | APB4, `paddr[7:0]`, no wait state, `pslverr` = 0 |

| `idma_legalizer_rw_axi.sv`, `idma_transport_layer_rw_axi.sv`, `idma_backend_rw_axi.sv` | backend | |

`gen_idma.py` is run through `python`: its shebang is wrong. `reg32_2d` is not in the
`idma.mk` default frontend list; that flow needs `IDMA_ADD_FE_IDS=reg32_2d`. None is
edited by hand. `design/dma/rtl/` holds the wrapper only.

## 7.7 Clock and reset

- Clock `o_clk_dma`, gateable by `CLK_EN[10]`; reset `o_rst_n_dma`, released with the
  other domains (`QNSC_SCRC_MAS` 7.5).
- The `SCRC` APB guard covers `APB_M13` only. Before gating the DMA, firmware waits
  until `DONE_ID` reaches the last launched ID; `STATUS` = 0 is not enough, since the
  last `B` response may still be on `S_BUS` (7.4).

# 8. Instances

One `m_qnsc_wrap_dma` in `design/top`.

# 9. What is not provided here, and who provides it

: Functions this block does not provide

| Function | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Hardware request from a peripheral | not provided; firmware starts every job from the peripheral's interrupt (7.3) |
| Descriptor chains, circular buffers | not provided; firmware launches the next job |
| Reporting an AXI error | not provided (7.5) |
| Memory fill without a source | not provided; copy from a zero buffer |
| Routing `AXI_S2` to memories and `AXI_M3` | `S_BUS` |

# 10. Tie-offs

: Tie-offs inside `m_qnsc_wrap_dma`

| Port | Tied to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend `busy_i`, `midend_busy_i` | backend `busy_o`, midend `busy_o` | `STATUS[7:0]`, `STATUS[8]`, and the idle NOR |
| Frontend `stream_idx_o` | open | One stream |
| ID generator `retire_i` | midend `nd_rsp_valid_o` | Once per job (3) |
| Midend `nd_rsp_ready_i` | 1 | Responses always taken |
| Midend `nd_rsp_o` | open | No error path (7.5) |
| Backend `idma_eh_req_i`, `eh_req_valid_i` | 0 | `NO_ERROR_HANDLING`; the ports exist |
| Backend `eh_req_ready_o` | open | Always 0 |
| AXI `user` on every channel | 0 | Not used on `S_BUS` |
| AXI `ar_prot`, `aw_prot` | as driven by the backend | Not checked by any QSOC slave |

# 11. Requirements on others, and open items

: Requirements on other owners

| Item | Owner | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `AXI_S2` ID width 5; `AXI_S2` reaches `AXI_M0`--`AXI_M3` | bus owner | 7.2 |
| UART wrapper drops `o_dma_tx_req`, `o_dma_rx_req` and the patch `0001-add-dma-request-lines` | UART owner | a vendor patch that nothing uses |
| Contract: close tbd "DMA peripheral channel for each requester"; interrupt line 0 note: idle level | lead | contract matching this block |

: HAS text this specification departs from

| `QSOC_HAS_Report_EN_v4_final` Table 10-1/10-2 says | This specification | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Three modes: register job, descriptor chain, eight peripheral channels | upstream frontend `reg` only | Mentor: open-source DMA, IP not redesigned; QSOC peripherals are slow enough for CPU-paced jobs |
| Configuration port `APB_M14` at `0x8003_8000` | `APB_M13` at `0x8003_4000` | Contract since `GPIO3` was dropped |
| `DMA_ISR` write-1-to-clear flags, `IRQ_MODE` | idle level from `STATUS` | The upstream frontend has no interrupt; an idle level needs no register |
| `axi_mux` 3:1 onto `AXI_S2` | wires | Without a descriptor fetch port only the read and write ports remain, on disjoint channels |

Open items, DMA owner:

- Generate the files of 7.6, `compute.svh` included, and commit them with the commands.
- Add the `cc_*` modules of section 4 to the `common_cells` copy, and vendor `apb`.
- Run the upstream `rw_axi` backend jobs and a wrapper test in simulation; confirm the
  idle window of 7.4 (`DMA_010`) and the waveform of 7.2.

Accepted limits:

- No AXI error is visible to software (7.5).
- A FIFO job is paced by firmware, not by the peripheral (7.3).
- One job at a time (7.1).

# 12. Verification

1. `DMA_001` Reset values, access and the 256-byte alias of section 6: `DONE_ID` = 1
   read first, `0xDC` and `0xF0`--`0xFF` read 0, `NEXT_ID` = 2 read last (the read
   launches a job; program a valid one first).
2. `DMA_002` A 1D job copies `LENGTH` bytes for unaligned addresses and lengths 1, 3,
   4, 5, 4096 and across a 4 KiB boundary.
3. `DMA_003` A 2D job with `DST_STRIDE` = 0 writes one address `REPS` times, in order.
4. `DMA_004` Two jobs, each launched after `DONE_ID` reached the previous ID, complete
   in order and `DONE_ID` reaches each ID.
5. `DMA_005` A read of `NEXT_ID` while a launch is still held launches nothing and
   returns the held job's ID; one job runs.
6. `DMA_006` `o_int_dma` is 1 exactly while `STATUS` = 0.
7. `DMA_007` A job to `UART0` at `0x8002_0000` through `S_BUS` and `P_BUS` (SoC test).
8. `DMA_008` Ibex and the DMA both reach `ISRAM` during a job; both complete (SoC test).
9. `DMA_009` The generated files match a regeneration from the pinned commit (CI).
10. `DMA_010` `o_int_dma` may rise after the last `W` beat and before `BVALID`; the
    handler of 7.4 never reports a job done early.
11. `DMA_011` Testbench assertions: no launch with `LENGTH` = 0, none with `REPS` = 0 and
    `enable_nd` = 1; the `DONE_ID` behaviour of 7.5 when violated.
12. `DMA_012` A 2D job with `REPS` > 1 advances `DONE_ID` exactly once.
13. `DMA_013` Distinct values in `DST_STRIDE`, `SRC_STRIDE`, `REPS` at `0xE0`, `0xE4`,
    `0xE8` give the expected burst addresses on `AXI_S2`.

| What is the DMA for if the CPU starts every job? | Vinh | Block copies and fast SPI without a CPU load/store per word; one interrupt per job, 2, 7.2 |
| `APB_M14` against contract `APB_M13` | lead, V3.0 | 6 |
| Stride and `REPS` offsets; `NEXT_ID`/`DONE_ID` reset | Vinh, V3.1 review | 6, 7.1 |
| ID retire from the backend counts every 1D transfer | Vinh, V3.1 review | 3, 10 |
| Idle before the last `B` response | Vinh, V3.1 review | 7.4, 7.7 |
| Zero `LENGTH`/`REPS`; missing `compute.svh`; error-handler ports | Vinh, V3.1 review | 7.5, 7.6, 10 |
| `APB` offset of 12 bits in a 16 KiB window | Vinh, V3.1 review | contract convention for every APB block (bus owner); the DMA decodes `paddr[7:0]` |
| A `done_pend` flag instead of the idle level | Vinh, V3.1 review | Not in V3.x: it adds a register to the wrapper |
